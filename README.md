## 1. Background

Chest (computed tomography) CT scanning is one of the most important technologies for COVID-19 diagnosis in the current clinical practice, which motivates more concerted efforts in developing AI-based diagnostic tools to alleviate the enormous burden on the medical system. We develop a lesion-attention deep neural network (LA-DNN) to predict COVID-19 positive or negative with a richly annotated chest CT image dataset. The CT image dataset contains 746 public chest CT images of COVID-19 patients collected from over 760 preprints, and the data annotations are accompanied with the textual radiology reports. We extract two types of important information from these annotations: One is the flag of whether an image indicates a positive or negative case of COVID-19, and the other is the description of five lesions on the CT images associated with the positive cases. The proposed data-driven LA-DNN model focuses on the primary task of binary classification for COVID-19 diagnosis, while an auxiliary multi-label learning task is implemented simultaneously to draw the model's attention to the five lesions of COVID-19 during the training. The joint task learning process makes it a highly sample-efficient deep model that can learn COVID-19 radiology features effectively with very limited samples. Our code is public in `./Code/`.

## 2. Data

* We used this public dataset: **"COVID-CT-Dataset: a CT scan dataset about COVID-19."** arXiv, 2020. <br>
  * More information about this base dataset can be found at:<br>
    * arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13865 <br>
    * dataset: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT<br>
  * We used the image caption in the meta-information provided by this dataset to add auxiliary labels for each COVID-19 sample, including Ground-glass opacities (GGO), Consolidation (Csld), Crazy paving appearance (CrPa), Air bronchograms (AirBr), and Interlobular septal thickening (InSepThi). New meta-information containing auxiliary labels can be found in `./data_split/COVID-CT-MetaInfo_new.csv`.
  * The split information of fine-tuned data can refer to `./data_split/train_meta.csv`, `./data_split/val_meta.csv`, `./data_split/test_meta.csv`.
  
* We will keep collecting new CT images for both COVID-19 and NonCOVID-19.
  * New samples will be updated at this folder `./New_data/`.
  * This dataset will be updated periodically. Hence, we name the folder of new data with the corresponding timestamp as a subdirectory of `./New_data/`. Suppose we add new CT images added on May 14, then the path will be:`./New_data/5.14/`. The positive and negative samples are separately stored with two zip files with names `./New_data/5.14/5.14_covidct.zip` and `./New_data/5.14/5.14_nocovidct.zip` respectively.
  * The meta-information of the new samples (e.g., image name, label, collection date and source, etc.) will be continuously updated in `./New_data/New_COVIDCT_meta(update to 5.14).csv` and `./New_data/New_NonCOVIDCT_meta(update to 5.14).csv`.

## 3. Online Diagnosis System

An online system has been developed for fast online diagnoses using CT images at the web address https://www.covidct.cn/. 

:satisfied: Welcome to visit!!! :satisfied:

  * You can quickly test a single sample or batch of samples following the navigation bar **Test → Single Image** or **Test → Batch of Images**.
  * We encourage clinicians, radiologists, and researchers to share more data to help us to improve this system. Data sharing can be achieved via the **Data Collection** channel of our website.
